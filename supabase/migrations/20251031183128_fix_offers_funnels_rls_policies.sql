  # Fix RLS Policies for Offers and Funnels
  
  1. Changes
    - Drop existing restrictive policies for offers and funnels
    - Create new permissive policies that allow anon users to insert/update/delete
    - This is necessary because the admin panel uses custom authentication with localStorage
      and doesn't use Supabase Auth, so users authenticate as 'anon' role
  
  2. Security
    - Still enable RLS on both tables
    - Allow anon users full CRUD operations (admin panel validates via edge function)
    - Public users can only SELECT active records
